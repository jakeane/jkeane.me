# jkeane.me Portfolio Frontend

This is the codebase for my portfolio frontend. Some of the information is hard coded in. However, as I am inherently lazy, I do not want to update this page whenever I am developing something new. To amend this issue, I run a scheduled task in the backend using the Heroku Scheduler plug-in, which uses the GitHub API to get and process data from my repositories.

While I was at this, I figured I could use another API to perform a similar task. So, I also use the Reddit API to get data from my personal subreddit, where I cross-post articles that I find interest in.

## TODO

- Make images in project page adaptable to amount of content.
- Add contact me page.
- Implement more thoughtful UI/UX design.
- "Load in" animations?
